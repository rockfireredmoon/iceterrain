        <h1>Editing Terrain</h1>

        <img style="float: left;" src="/Interface/Styles/Gold/Common/Icons/select.png"/><h2>Select Mode</h2>

        Shows general operations for the current tile. <i>More will be added here soon.</i>

        <img style="float: left;" src="/Interface/Styles/Gold/Common/Icons/brush.png"/><h2>Paint Mode</h2>

        Lets you raise or lower the terrain. Click once to raise or lower by the current amount,
        or click and hold to repeat. 

        Press <b>Ctrl</b> to reverse the brush, i.e. paint becomes erase, erase becomes paint.

        <img style="float: left;" src="/Interface/Styles/Gold/Common/Icons/roller.png"/><h2>Flatten Mode</h2>

        Click once to set the elevation you want to flatten too, then click and drag to paint
        the flattened terrain.

        <img style="float: left;" src="/Interface/Styles/Gold/Common/Icons/splat.png"/><h2>Splat Mode</h2>

        Lets you paint the 4 textures allowed per tile. You can choose the texture image, 
        or select it as the current brush, as well as edit clutter definitions for that 
        texture.

        Click once to paint, or click and hold to repeat. 

        <img style="float: left;" src="/Interface/Styles/Gold/Common/Icons/wave.png"/><h2>Liquid Plane</h2>

        Choose a water plane, then use the spinner to move the elevation up and down.

        <h2>Options</h2>

        The options window lets you change various settings which affect performance and visual
        quality. If it's running slow for you, or you wish to see what the terrain looks like
        with other settings, play with stuff in here.

        <h2>Other Goodies</h2>

        Press F12 to toggle recording MJPEG videos to <b>HOME%/Documents/Iceterrain/Videos</b> (probably 
        will need processing in an editor before uploading).
