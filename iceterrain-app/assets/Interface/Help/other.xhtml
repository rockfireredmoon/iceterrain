        The options window lets you change various settings which affect performance and visual
        quality. If it's running slow for you, or you wish to see what the terrain looks like
        with other settings, play with stuff in here.

        <a name="#video" id="video"><h2>Video Recording</h2></a>

        Press F12 to toggle recording MJPEG videos to <b>HOME%/Documents/Iceterrain/Videos</b>. 
        This file is raw JPEG images, so should be processed in a video tool before uploading
        (it can get pretty big).
